This Ruby assessment features a user defined method to take input of a single word, as well as a sentence,
and gives a numerical value as to how many times that user's single word shows up in the sentence they
put in. It also features the necessary files and stylesheets to produce a website using the Sinatra gem.

Setup for the website is very easy. Once the entirety of the file is downloaded, make sure that your
terminal is in the top level directory of the downloaded file, and run the gem 'ruby app.rb' (if you have
the sinatra gem installed). Then, in your internet browser, put in the browser bar 'localhost:' and 
whatever number sinatra gives you for the host location. This number is typically 4567. Once you've
accessed the webpage, just follow the basic instructions, click the button, and it will take you to a new
webpage with your results.
